iDownloader-PRO
===============

Source code of one of my iOS personal projects I made in the Summer of 2012

This project can be used for learning purposes only. It cannot be used as it is for commercial purposes.

If you want to make a similar project for the App Store, please note:

- The project was created in 2012 in Objective-C, but now developers tend to switch to Swift, which may be the future of iOS & Mac OS X Development.

- It is made with .xib files, and the target devices are iPhone Retina 3.5 and iPad Retina. If you want to make it compatible with all the divices, you may need to create a Universal Storyboard and use AutoLayout.

- The network/Internet interaction functionality is made using the built-in classes that come with the iOS SDKs, i.e. no third-party libraries like AFNetworking, that you may consider instead now.

- For downloading files, the NSURLConnection class was used. In iOS 7 and later, you may consider NSURLSession.
